# How to generate a release

1. Make your changes in a branch and open a PR with `master` as the base branch
2. stage those changes by opening a PR between your working branch and `staging`
3. when youâ€™re ready to add that commit to a release, merge the PR into `staging`.
4. the action will automatically run and either open a release PR with all the PRs and commits that have been merged in `staging` and that area currently open against `master`
